The development of civic values and attitudes of tolerance and respect for the rights of diverse social groups among youth are essential for sustainable democratic societies. These values are strongly promoted by families, educational systems and international organizations across the world. The measurements and comparison of these attitudes among youth can provide valuable information about their development in different societies and over time.  
\newline  
Same international studies such as the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) provide extensive comparative information regarding these aspects. The ICCS study is a large-scale assessment (survey) applied in more than 25 educational systems during the last three cycles and focused on secondary education (representative samples of 8th graders, 14-year-olds in each country) addressing topics such as citizenship, diversity and social interactions at school. The study produces internationally comparative data collected via student, school and teacher questionnaires. Data from different waves of the ICCS survey is publicly available to researchers. The first time this study was applied was in 1999 to 28 countries and it was called CIVED, the second wave started using the name ICCS and was implemented in 2009 in 38 countries, the last study was performed in 2016 to 24 countries. The next cycle is scheduled for 2022 and 25 countries will participate.  
\newline 
Previous research using ICCS data has been largely focused on average country comparisons of attitudinal measures such as attitudes toward equal rights for immigrants, ethnic minorities and women, norms of good citizenship behaviour and political participation. Most of these studies employed variable-centered analyses. Nevertheless, recent studies started to show the usefulness of person-centered approaches (i.e. latent class analysis, hereafter LCA) aimed at identifying profiles of young peopleâ€™s attitudes. For example, using ICCS 2009 data, [@hooghe_comparative_2016] compare profiles of good citizenship norms across 38 countries and distinguished distinctive subgroups of the population that share a common understanding of what constitutes good citizenship were identified (e.g. who express either engaged or duty-based citizenship norms).  
\newline 
Another study focused their research on changes over time (where the research design and data gathering methods are strictly comparable) [@hooghe_rise_2015]. For this, CIVED 1999 and ICCS 2009 was used. The scope of the analysis was threefold. First, distinct profiles of good citizenship norms were identified in both cycles. Second, trends over time were investigated and finally, differences between countries and/over time were analysed in detail. Nevertheless, most of these studies employing LCA with ICCS data focused on patterns within a particular type of attitude described by individual items (e.g. citizenship norms) leaving space for investigations that aim to capture a wider set of attitudinal measures described by scores on different variables.  
\newline 
To address this gap, this research will approach the topic of tolerance and respect for the rights operationalized as a multifaceted set of attitudes toward equal rights for women. This topic was addressed by previous studies aimed at comparing these attitudinal measures mostly in isolation across countries and over time. However, to date, no studies addressed the potential interdependence in these attitudinal dimensions among different subgroups of people (e.g. highly tolerant, highly intolerant regarding all aspects, etc.). Therefore, the current study aims to fill this gap by addressing the following research questions:    
\newline
1. What profiles of tolerance and respect for the rights of women are observed among adolescents in different countries?  
2. Are these profiles comparable across countries and over time?    
3. What individual and contextual factors are associated with profile membership? Do they vary depending on the context of the country or the cohort?
