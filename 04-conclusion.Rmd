# Discussion and conclusion  

This research focused on identify different patterns of students' attitudes of tolerance and respect for the rights of diverse social groups among youth, particularly women and ethnics and races groups. Due to the lack of previous research on this matter the study started without having any hypotheses, the research questions were based on exploring the different possible profiles of students that could be found in ICCS 2016 study regarding the student' endorsement of equal rights and opportunities scale.

In order to achieve this goal, the most suitable methodology is Latent Class Analysis, exploratory and confirmatory approach was implemented along with the study of invariance across 14 European countries. 

Despite the complexity of identifying reliable and interpretable profiles for the sample, the analysis provided strong evidence to identify the most common profiles across countries. This would be of great help as starting point for next researchers who intend to identify more specific profiles of students or even when including more countries in the polled sample. 

The person-centred approach gives the possibility to explore how different profiles can be identified within the indicators that were calculated by the consortium. With this, now is not only possible to compare the countries in a average level of the students' attitudes toward equal rights but also it is possible to learn how each country population is composed, by which subgroups of students attitudes or patterns. Latent Class Analysis was a great tool for identifying these profiles based on a statistical approach, with tests and statistics that give strong evidence to state why those profiles were identified. 

As expected by the variable-centre results, most countries indicators values for the student' endorsement of equal rights and opportunities are high, this means, that a high level of agreement with the notion of gender and ethnic/race equality is shown by the students. But this approach does not give information about the differences between students that achieve a high score and medium score. With this research, it was possible to expand that group into subgroups of students with different attitudes towards this subject. 

It is interesting to evidence that while most of the profiles are similar across countries, the number of students that relate to those profiles is not. This result was expected due to cultural background, particularly in countries more open to gender equality and cultural diversity such as nordic countries.  

As a first conclusion, it is clear to say that complete comparability is not assured when we look at subpopulations patterns when analyzing Large Scale Assessments. Even though is it confirmed that at a variable level this comparison is straightforward, this does not apply necessary when comparing all different subgroups that can be identified within a country with another.    

If the objective is to evaluate the subgroups that can be found in more than one country, the best strategy is to conduct first independent country models. This way the analysis will allow to identify and select common patterns in LSA scales. Not only similar groups or subpopulations can be found, but also unique (country-specific) groups can be found. With this, particular realities (patterns) can be distinguished when performing individual models.

Another interesting finding of this research is that it is possible to test if the patterns are invariant across countries. With it, it is possible to state that the profiles are similar across countries but not the class sizes, as they differ across countries when complete homogeneity was not achieved. This would mean that even though the patterns of the conditional probabilities are equal, the unconditional probabilities cannot be assumed to be equal across countries. In other words, the classes exist in most of the countries, but the number of respondents estimated to have that attribute differs.  

For the Students' endorsement of gender equality scale, it was clear that two classes are highly similar across countries, Fully egalitarian and Competition-driven sexism. And it is established in this research that these classes can be compared across countries, but only by the conditional probabilities. The class sizes (unconditional probabilities) cannot be compared. When looking at the visualization of the response patterns some neighbouring countries can share some patterns.

The confirmatory approach gives clear evidence of the strong agreement with gender equality based on opportunities in the government. Similarly, the relation that the second-highest probability to agree is shared by two items in the Fully egalitarian class and by one item in the Competitive-driven sexism class equally. More interesting is that students in the Competition-driven sexism class would not have a clear attitude towards women in politics.  

For the Students' endorsement of equal rights for all ethnic/racial groups, three classes are found as highly similar across countries, Fully egalitarian, Political non-egalitarian and Non-egalitarian. In contrast to the previous scale, no more clear patterns are identified across countries. 

A clear pattern of random response can be identified not only in this scale but for gender equality as well. Even though the size of this class is not greater than 10% in most countries, some of them are around 20% (Malta), meaning that some students are not engaged either positive or negative in having an opinion about these matters. 

The confirmatory approach gives evidence of the relation between the level of agreement between the Fully egalitarian and Political non-egalitarian classes. And how this relation is contrary to the Non-egalitarian class.  

One of the limitations of this research is that it is not clear if there is an impact of inverse worded items in these patterns. Particularly the competition-driven sexism class in gender equality scale shows a clear change pattern regarding negative wording. It would be very interesting to study how students pay attention to the reasoning behind the negative meaning of the item.   

An advantage for this type of research is that is based on statistical analysis, the profiles can be defined without hard theoretical background as an exploratory approach. Still, it is encouraged to improve the interpretation of these profiles by specialists in the topic of youth social attitudes to evaluate other confirmatory approaches, that way, theoretical hypotheses can be tested.  

This research it is of great help for researchers that want to perform the same analysis but for comparing different cycles of the study, as it was mentioned, these scales are present in the study from 2009 and they will be present in the next cycle of 2022. Measurement invariance can be tested for both cycles using the same scales and countries. In the case of researchers interested in other countries, these results can be used for comparative purposes.   

As a recommendation for future research, it is important to suggest having an ordered strategy to analyze the data, as more countries are added into the analysis more complex the analysis gets. Countries to be included must be chosen wisely to avoid unwanted external factors in the results.
