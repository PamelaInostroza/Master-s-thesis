# Methods 


All cycles of ICCS (CIVED) have been validated through variable-centred analysis, this means that latent constructs and the invariance across countries have been consistently validated thoroughly using CFA. On the contrary, not many research has been done using person-centred approaches, as Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) and Latent Class analysis (LCA).  
\newline 
The latent class model assumes the existence of a latent categorical variable such that the observed response variables are conditionally independent, given that variable. LCA treat a contingency table as a finite mixture of unobserved tables generated under a conditional independence structure of a latent variable [@agresti_categorical_2013]. In other words, LCA can directly assess the theory that distinctive groups of people share specific attitudes. Depending on the response variable in the model the analysis is called Latent Profile Analysis if is continuous (Normal) and Latent Class Analysis if the response variable is categorical (Multinomial).  
\newline 
In LCA, studying measurement invariance is necessary to determine whether the number and nature of the latent profiles are the same across the different observed groups [@olivera-aguilar_assessing_2018]. For this, multiple group LCA models are computed, and the relative fit of the unconstrained and semi-constrained models are compared using the LRT, AIC, BIC, and aBIC measures. Also is needed to review any kind of response bias, the most common refers to “a systematic tendency to respond to a range of questionnaire items on some basis other than the specific item content” for example e.g. extreme or agree/disagree [@kankaras_measurement_2011].  
\newline 
In order to assess the cross-national and cross-cohort comparability using CFA, new scales should be created that fit across all countries and cohorts analysed, rather than using the ones already created by the consortium [@barber_profiles_2020].  
\newline 
Descriptive and main report was performed in R software using poLCA package (Robertson and Kaptein 2016). Most complex analysis was implemented in MPLUS. All syntax used is available in
