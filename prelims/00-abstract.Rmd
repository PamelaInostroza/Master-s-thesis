The preface pretty much says it all.  \par

Second paragraph of abstract starts here.

Civic education is an important subject for every citizen in our modern society. It is important that every individual acknowledge the importance of the civil rights and obligations of any citizen. One of the most commented topics is how society faces and behaves towards the great diversity of individuals and cultures. Students are a great population to be studied as they are forming their own mindset and attitudes. Using ICCS 2016, an international large-scale assessment, it is possible to identify which are the most common behaviors among students' attitudes considering different aspects of equality towards women and ethnic and racial groups. As expected, the most common pattern is composed of students that share a high chance to accept and promote equality towards women and ethnics groups. Nonetheless, there is a small number of students that tend to disagree with this equality. Another set of students shares a high level of agreement with both minorities' equal rights but do not agree with their political role in society. Student's endorsement towards woman's rights remaining pattern shares a high level of agreement towards equality in basic rights but favor towards men when competing for jobs or political roles. Another pattern identified towards ethnic groups is students that disagree with their equal right to have good jobs. These patterns are similar across the 14 countries studied in Europe but they differ in the number of individuals in each pattern.
