	abstract = {Analytic techniques developed for big data have much broader applications in the social sciences, outperforming standard regression models even—or rather especially—in smaller datasets. This article offers an overview of machine learning methods well-suited to social science problems, including decision trees, dimension reduction methods, nearest neighbor algorithms, support vector models, and penalized regression. In addition to novel algorithms, machine learning places great emphasis on model checking (through holdout samples and cross-validation) and model shrinkage (adjusting predictions toward the mean to reduce overfitting). This article advocates replacing typical regression analyses with two different sorts of models used in concert. A multi-algorithm ensemble approach should be used to determine the noise floor of a given dataset, while simpler methods such as penalized regression or decision trees should be used for theory building and hypothesis testing.},

Moving beyond purely cross-sectional analyses, multilevel longitudinal analyses of such datasets should generate substantively important insights into the political, social and economic correlates of many individual-level outcomes of interest (attitudes, behaviors, etc.). This article describes two simple techniques for extracting such insights, which allow change over time in y to be a function of change over time in x and/or of a time-invariant x. The article presents results from simulation studies that assess the techniques in the presence of complications that are likely to arise with real-world data, and concludes with applications to the issues of generalized social trust and postmaterialist values, using data from World/European Values Surveys.},

	abstract = {This contribution focuses on a model that is gaining currency in cross-national research, namely multilevel structural equation modelling ({MSEM}). Similarly to standard multilevel modelling ({MLM}), this model distinguishes between various levels of analysis (e. g., individuals nested within countries) and, in doing so, takes the hierarchical structure of cross-national data into account. However, {MSEM} incorporates a latent-variable approach into the multilevel framework, making it possible to assess the measurement quality of latent constructs. As such, {MSEM} is a synthesis of structural equation modeling ({SEM}) and {MLM} that combines the best of both worlds. The {MSEM} approach makes it possible to model multilevel mediations and group-level outcomes, and therefore provides a more complete representation of Coleman’s bathtub model. This contribution presents the statistical and conceptual background of {MSEM} in a formal but accessible manner. The paper discusses applications of {MSEM} that are particularly useful for cross-national comparative research ({CNCR}), namely two-level confirmatory factor analysis ({CFA}), multilevel mediation models, and models for group-level outcomes. A practical step-by-step strategy on how {MSEM} can be used for applied research is provided and illustrated by means of a didactical example.},

Chapter headings remain essentially with the exception of a new one on Bayesian inference for parametric models. Other major changes include an expansion of clustered data, new research on analysis of data sets with robust variables, extensive discussions of ordinal data, more on interpretation, and additional exercises throughout the book.

Using data from 16 countries participating in the 1999 and 2009 International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement civic education studies, we identified five attitudinal profiles. Profiles defined by negative attitudes toward diverse social groups decreased over time, whereas profiles defined by very positive attitudes toward diverse groups increased, particularly in western Europe. Although some post-Communist countries demonstrated trends toward more positive attitudinal profiles, others trended toward profiles defined by weaker citizenship norms. Across countries and cohorts, more positive profiles were associated with stronger school climates and expectations of civic participation.},

Past accounts suggest two clusters of explanations based on interests and exposure. Using these, we examine opinions on abortion, sexual behavior, public sphere gender roles, and family responsibilities. We find that attitudes have continued to liberalize and converge with the exception of abortion attitudes. The determinants of feminist opinion vary across domains, but have been largely stable. While not identical, the predictors of men and women's opinions are similar. The results suggest the need for more attention to the mechanisms underlying the production of feminist opinions and theoretical integration of both interests and exposure in a dynamic process.},

It discusses the analysis of categorical data using three models: a full model, a log-linear model and a logistic regression model. It is a valuable resource for survey statisticians and practitioners in the field of sociology, biology, economics, psychology and other areas who have to use these procedures in their day-to-day work. It is also useful for courses on sampling and complex surveys at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. The importance of sample surveys today cannot be overstated. From voters' behaviour to fields such as industry, agriculture, economics, sociology, psychology, investigators generally resort to survey sampling to obtain an assessment of the behaviour of the population they are interested inches Many large-scale sample surveys collect data using complex survey designs like multistage stratified cluster designs. The observations using these complex designs are not independently and identically distributed - an assumption on which the classical procedures of inference are based. This means that if classical tests are used for the analysis of such data, the inferences obtained will be inconsistent and often invalid. For this reason, many modified test procedures have been developed for this purpose over the last few decades},

	abstract = {Prepare and analyze data from large-scale assessments and surveys with
complex sampling and assessment design (see 'Rutkowski', 2010. Such studies are, for example,
international assessments like '{TIMSS}', '{PIRLS}' and '{PISA}'. A graphical
interface is available for the non-technical user.The package includes
functions to covert the original data from '{SPSS}' into 'R' data sets
keeping the user-defined missing values, merge data from different
respondents and/or countries, generate variable dictionaries, modify
data, produce descriptive statistics (percentages, means, percentiles,
benchmarks) and multivariate statistics (correlations, linear
regression, binary logistic regression).},
