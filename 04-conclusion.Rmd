# Discussion and conclusion  

This research started without having any previous hypotheses, the research questions were based on exploring the different possible profiles of students that could be found in ICCS 2016 study regarding the student' endorsement of equal rights and opportunities. Despite the complexity of identifying reliable and interpretable profiles for the sample, the analysis provided strong evidence to identify the most common profiles across countries. This would be of great help for next researchers who intend to identify more specific profiles of students or even when including more countries in the polled sample. 

The person-centred approach gives the possibility to explore how different the indicators that were calculated by the consortium are. With this, now is not only possible to compare the countries in a general level of the students' attitudes toward equal rights but also it is possible to learn how each country is composed, by which subgroups of students. 

Latent Class Analysis was a great tool for identifying these profiles based on a statistical approach, with tests and statistics that give strong evidence to state why those profiles should be identified. 

As expected by the variable-centre results, most countries indicators values for the student' endorsement of equal rights and opportunities are high, this means, that a high level of agreement with the notion of gender and ethnic/race equality is shown. But this approach does not give information about the differences between students that achieve a high score and medium score. With this research, it was possible to expand that group into groups of students with different attitudes towards this subject. 

It was also interesting to identify that while most of the profiles are similar across countries, the number of students that relate to those profiles is not similar across countries.  And particularly, that country-specific profiles could be observed. 

As a first conclusion, it is clear to say that complete comparability is not assured when we look at subpopulations patterns when analyzing Large Scale Assessments. Even though is it confirmed that at a variable level this comparison is straightforward, this does not apply necessary when comparing all different groups that can be identified within a country with another country.  

If the objective is to compare the groups that can be found in more than one country the best strategy is to conduct independent country models, this way the analysis will allow to identify and select common patterns in LSA scales. Not only similar groups or subpopulations can be found, but also unique (country-specific) groups can be found. With this, particular realities (patterns) can be distinguished when performing individual models.

One of the most interesting parts of this research was that it could be tested if the patterns are invariant across countries. With it, was possible to state that the profiles were similar across countries but not the class sizes, as they differ across countries when complete homogeneity was not achieved, this would mean that even though the patterns of the conditional probabilities are equal, the unconditional probabilities can not be assumed to be equal across countries. This would mean that the classes exist in most of the countries but the number of respondents estimated to have that attribute differs across countries.  

For the Students' endorsement of gender equality scale, it was clear that two classes are highly similar across countries, Fully egalitarian and Competition-driven sexism. And it was established that these can be compared across countries, but only by the conditional probabilities. The class sizes (unconditional probabilities) can not be compared.  

When looking at the visualization of the response patterns it is clear that some neighbouring countries can share some patterns. But as indicated before not clearly in class size but in the level of agreement with the items.  

The confirmatory approach gives a clear interpretation of the strong agreement with gender equality based on opportunities in the government, along with the relation that the second-highest probability to agree is shared by two items in the Fully egalitarian class and by one item in the Competitive-driven sexism class equally. Most interesting is that students in the Competition-driven sexism class would not have a clear attitude towards women in politics.  

For the Students' endorsement of equal rights for all ethnic/racial groups, three classes are found as highly similar across countries, Fully egalitarian, Political non-egalitarian and Non-egalitarian. In contrast to the previous scale, not more clear patterns are identified across countries. Some particular patterns are found but not with sustainable class size. 

A clear pattern of random response can be identified not only in this scale but for gender equality as well. Even though the size of this class is not greater than 10% in most countries, some of them are around 20% (Malta), meaning that some students are not engaged either positive or negative in having an opinion about these matters. 

The confirmatory approach gives a clear interpretation of the relation between the level of agreement between the Fully egalitarian and Political non-egalitarian classes. And how this relation is contrary to the Non-egalitarian class.  

One of the limitations of this research is that it is not clear if there is an impact of inverse worded items in these patterns. Particularly the competition-driven sexism class in gender equality scale shows a clear change pattern regarding negative wording. It would very interesting to study how students pay attention to the reasoning behind the negative meaning of the item.   

An advantage for this type of research is that based on statistical analysis, the profiles can be defined without hard theoretical background as an exploratory approach. Later on, with the specialist in the topic, those profiles could be cleaned or optimized. 

This research can be used as a starting point in future researches, to evaluate different hypotheses to be tested. It also is of great help for other researchers that want to perform the same analysis but for different cycles of the study, as it was mentioned that these scales are present in the study from 2009 and they will be present in the next cycle of 2022. In the case of researchers interested in other countries, these results can be used for comparative purposes.   

As a recommendation for future research, I would suggest having an ordered strategy to analyze the data, as more countries are added into the analysis more complex the analysis gets. Choose wisely the countries included in order to avoid external factors in the results.
