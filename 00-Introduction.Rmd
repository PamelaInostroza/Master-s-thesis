The development of civic values and attitudes of tolerance and respect for the rights of diverse social groups among youth is essential for sustainable democratic societies. These values are strongly promoted by families, educational systems, and international organizations across the world. The measurements and comparison of these attitudes among youth can provide valuable information about their development in different societies.  

International studies such as the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) provide extensive comparative information regarding these aspects. The ICCS study is a large-scale assessment (survey) applied in more than 25 educational systems during the last three cycles and focused on secondary education (representative samples of 8th graders, 14-year-olds in each country) addressing topics such as citizenship, diversity, and social interactions at school. 

Previous research using ICCS data has been largely focused on average country comparisons of attitudinal measures such as attitudes toward equal rights for immigrants, ethnic minorities and women, norms of good citizenship behavior and political participation. Most of these studies employed variable-centered analyses. Nevertheless, recent studies started to show the usefulness of person-centered approaches (i.e., latent class analysis, hereafter LCA) aimed at identifying profiles of young peopleâ€™s attitudes. For example, using ICCS 2009 data, [@hooghe_comparative_2016] compare profiles of good citizenship norms across 38 countries and distinguished distinctive subgroups of the population that share a common understanding of what constitutes good citizenship were identified (e.g., who express either engaged or duty-based citizenship norms).  

Nevertheless, most of these studies employing LCA with ICCS data focused on patterns within a particular type of attitude described by individual items (e.g., citizenship norms) leaving space for investigations that aim to capture a wider set of attitudinal measures described by scores on different variables.  

To address this gap, this research will approach the topic of tolerance and respect for the rights operationalized as a multifaceted set of attitudes toward equal rights for women and ethnic/race minorities. This topic was addressed by previous studies aimed at comparing these attitudinal measures mostly in isolation across countries and over time. However, to date, no studies addressed the potential interdependence in these attitudinal dimensions among different subgroups of people (e.g., highly tolerant, highly intolerant regarding all aspects, etc.). Therefore, the current study aims to fill this gap by addressing the following research questions:    

- What profiles of attitudes towards gender equality are observed among adolescents?  
- What profiles of tolerance and respect for equal rights of ethnic/race groups are observed among adolescents?   
- Are these profiles comparable across countries?    
- It is possible to state a confirmatory model for these profiles?  


This research aims to answer these questions for an extensive set of countries, mainly European countries that had a variety of geographical locations, languages, and economical backgrounds. This is important to avoid including external factors that can impact the clear interpretation of the results.  This study will be focused on the last ICCS study available from 2016, including 14 European countries and two endorsement scales regarding attitudes towards gender equality and ethnic/race equal rights.    

The study starts with a study of previous research performed in this matter and the statistical background that need to be considered to perform correctly this analysis. Subsequently, the analysis and summary of the results are discussed. Finally, results are discussed, and a conclusion is given.
