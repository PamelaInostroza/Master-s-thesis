	abstract = {"A classic in its own right, this book continues to provide an introduction to modern generalized linear models for categorical variables. The text emphasizes methods that are most commonly used in practical application, such as classical inferences for two- and three-way contingency tables, logistic regression, loglinear models, models for multinomial (nominal and ordinal) responses, and methods for repeated measurement and other forms of clustered, correlated response data. Chapter headings remain essentially with the exception of a new one on Bayesian inference for parametric models. Other major changes include an expansion of clustered data, new research on analysis of data sets with robust variables, extensive discussions of ordinal data, more on interpretation, and additional exercises throughout the book. R and SAS are now showcased as the software of choice. An author web site with solutions, commentaries, software programs, and data sets is available"--},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine profiles of students’ attitudes toward citizenship norms and inclusiveness in the political process, focusing on changes in the frequency of particular profiles and in the strength of predictors across a decade. Using data from 16 countries participating in the 1999 and 2009 International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement civic education studies, we identified five attitudinal profiles. Profiles defined by negative attitudes toward diverse social groups decreased over time, whereas profiles defined by very positive attitudes toward diverse groups increased, particularly in western Europe. Although some post-Communist countries demonstrated trends toward more positive attitudinal profiles, others trended toward profiles defined by weaker citizenship norms. Across countries and cohorts, more positive profiles were associated with stronger school climates and expectations of civic participation.},
